                <h2>Fundraising</h2>
                    <p>Basicly every group has to do some sort of fundraising. Some do more then others, some just do bottle drives and others do weekend long barbeques. The fundraising events usually are what pays for the larger trips like jamborees. Fundraising is not boring like you may think. really it is just going out with a group of friends and doing interesting things. For example at a BBQ all you are doing is handing food to people or cooking.</p>


                <h2>Ceremonies/Celebrations</h2>
                    <p>Most Venture groups are in remembrance day parades and ceremonies. For example, this year multiple Venture groups helped with the wreath laying in Poco and were in the parade. Some groups hand out or sell poppy's as well at this time. Venture groups usually also participate in the Canada and May day parades some also use them as fundraising opertunitys to do things like BBQ's. </p>

                <h2>Day Trips</h2>
                    <p>Day trips are a huge part of Ventures they happen either on weekends or sometimes replace meetings. What is done on the day trips varys everytime. some groups only do hiking day trips and some groups do things like go karting and lazer tag. Even if your group is doing something you are not interested is they are always fun because you get to hang out with your friends. Some groups do more day trips then others but almost every group does at least a few.</p>

                <h2>Meetings</h2>
                    <p>Meetings are very diffrent in Ventures compared to other sections of Scouting. Meetings in Ventures are alot less formal, people don't where uniforms, ther is not really organized activities, and they kind of just hang out and slowly get the necessary work done. The only exceptions to this is when they do day trips instead of a true meeting.</p>
