                <h2>Backpacking</h2>
                    <p>Backcountry backpacking is the main type of camp done in Ventures. The camps are always different and always result in amazing views and awesome experiences. The backpacking camps can vary a lot in length some are 4km flat and some are 20km almost vertical. You have to pack light for these camps this means the food is usually not great but the views at the top of mountain makes it worth it.</p>

                <h2>Work Camps</h2>
                    <p>Work camps are where Ventures go to camps to fundraise, volunteer or help the lower scouting sections. Some Venture groups own camp grounds and have to do general upkeep. A lot of Scout camps are actually owned by Venture or Scout groups. Some camps Ventures help the leaders set up activities for lower sections, there are many camps that would not be able to run without the immense amount of work put in by Ventures.</p>

                <h2>Social Camps</h2>
                    <p>Social camps are events where scouts from all different groups around the same area go to a camp together.  These camps are full of things like food eating contests, archery, cooking competitions, and even rock climbing walls. Theres always loud music and parties on the last night of the camp which is always the highlight.</p>
