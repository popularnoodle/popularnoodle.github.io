                <h2>What Is Ventures?</h2>
                    <p>Ventures (aka Vents) is a section in Scouts for people between the ages of 14 and 18. Unlike other sections of the Scouting program Ventures plan everything themselves. There is very little adult intervention unless there is something dangerous going on. All of the budgeting, food, and planning is all up to the youth.</p>


                <h2>What Do You Learn?</h2>
                    <p>You learn a lot as a Venture. You and your group get to pick what you do and what you learn about so it can depend on the group but there are a few things that are the same in all groups. All groups do a lot of backcountry backpacking and most groups do canoeing. You learn how to tie all sorts of knots and how to properly cook. Some groups have a bigger focus on First Aid like MedVents, some learn what to do in emergencys like SAR Scouts, and some focus on sailing like Sea Scouts.</p>

                <h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>
                    <p>Ventures costs around $270 for a year membership. Camps also cost money and they vary a lot on price. A backpacking trip can cost $60 but a world jamboree can cost up to 6 thousand (most groups pay for most of it but some don’t). If you go to about six camps in a year it will cost you around $750. This is assuming you have your own gear to use, if you don’t you can get used camping gear for pretty cheap but it will probably cost another $150.</p>


                <h2>What If I Don't Have A Group Near Me?</h2>
                    <p>If there is not a venture group near your location you are not completely out of luck. For example 4th Poco Ventures was created just a few years ago when some Scouts aged out of the program. They created the Venture company and it went from only 5 kids now to almost 25, the group grew this much in only five years. If you really want to join a group and there is none near you, you can create one yourself.</p>

                <h2>How Do I Know If Vents Is For Me?</h2>
                <p>Ventures is for everyone. Even if you may not be in great shape or if you have a disability no one is left behind. If you have an interest in the outdoors or want to meet new people Ventures in perfect for you. There are all sorts of camps, even if you dont like the intense backcountry hiking you can go to social, sailing, or volunteer camps.
